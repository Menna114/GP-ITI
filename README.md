🚀 Part 1 : Infrastructure Overview and Module Breakdown
Overview 🛠️

This setup provisions the core cloud infrastructure on AWS using modular Terraform components. It features a secure network architecture, a production-grade EKS cluster, and a remote backend for managing Terraform state. Each element is designed to be reusable, scalable, and version-controlled to support long-term maintainability.

This infrastructure acts as the backbone for integrating CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, ArgoCD, and the External Secrets Operator, enabling secure and automated application deployments.
Modules 🧩
network Module 🌐

This module provisions the networking components of the infrastructure:

    VPC: A Virtual Private Cloud to isolate and secure the environment.
    Subnets:
        3 public subnets across 3 AZs for external resources.
        3 private subnets for internal resources like EKS node groups.
    NAT Gateway: Provides internet access to resources in private subnets.
    Internet Gateway: Allows public subnets to access the internet.
    Route Tables: Configures routes between the subnets and the internet.

eks Module 🛠️

This module provisions the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster and related resources:

    EKS Control Plane: The API server and management layer for Kubernetes.
    EKS Node Groups: EC2 instances running in private subnets to manage containerized workloads.
    IAM Roles and Policies: Grants necessary permissions to EKS and EC2 nodes for interaction with AWS services.

ebs Module 💾

The EBS (Elastic Block Store) module provisions an Amazon EBS volume to provide persistent storage for applications running within the Amazon EKS cluster. This ensures that the state of the application or database is stored securely and can survive pod restarts. The module creates an EBS volume with specified storage size and type. The volume can be attached to EKS worker nodes or specific pods within the Kubernetes cluster for persistent data storage.
ecr Module 📦

The ECR (Elastic Container Registry) module provisions an Amazon ECR repository for storing Docker images. The repository allows you to securely store and manage Docker images that can be used within the EKS cluster. Once an image is pushed to the ECR repository, it can be pulled by Kubernetes pods for deployment, supporting the CI/CD pipeline by storing containerized application images.
roles Module 🔑

This module provisions IAM roles and policies required for controlling access to AWS resources, particularly for integration with the External Secrets Operator.

    External Secrets Role: An IAM role with a trust policy that allows the External Secrets Operator service account to assume the role with web identity via the OIDC provider.
    External Secrets Policy: An IAM policy granting the necessary permissions for the External Secrets Operator to interact with AWS Secrets Manager and retrieve secrets.
    Policy Attachment: This attaches the policy to the IAM role to allow the role to perform the required actions on AWS Secrets Manager.

secret_manager Module 🔒

This module integrates AWS Secrets Manager to securely manage and store sensitive information:

    Secrets: The module stores database credentials, Redis credentials, or any other secrets required by the Node.js app.
    IAM Permissions: Roles and policies are defined to allow the Kubernetes pods to access these secrets securely.

Setup Instructions ⚙️
Prerequisites 🔑

Before running Terraform, ensure you have the following:

    AWS Account: Access to provision AWS resources in your AWS account.
    Terraform: Installed locally or in a CI/CD pipeline. You can download Terraform from here.
    AWS CLI: Installed and configured with the correct credentials. Run aws configure to set up your AWS CLI if you haven’t already.
    IAM Permissions: Ensure your IAM user has permissions to create VPCs, subnets, EKS clusters, and related resources.
    Git: Installed for cloning the repository.

Step-by-Step Setup 📝
1. Clone the Repository 🔄

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone <https://github.com/DanaMostafa48/GP-ITI>
cd GP-ITI/terraform

2. Initialize Terraform 🔧

Initialize the Terraform working directory to download necessary provider plugins:

terraform init

3. Apply the Terraform Configuration 🚀

🚀 Part 4+5 : Kubernetes Deployment Guide: Node.js + MySQL + Redis on AWS EKS
Overview 🛠️

You're deploying a full-stack application with:

    A Node.js API
    A MySQL database
    A Redis cache

All deployed to an AWS EKS cluster using Kubernetes and managed declaratively with Kustomize.

Your secrets (passwords, credentials) live in AWS Secrets Manager, and are securely pulled into the cluster using the External Secrets Operator (ESO).
✅ Step 1: Enable Kubernetes to Access AWS Secrets Manager 🔐

Purpose: Let the cluster talk to AWS Secrets Manager.
🔐 Secrets Management

The goal is to securely manage sensitive information like passwords and API keys without hardcoding them into your Kubernetes resources.

We’ll set up a system where:

    Kubernetes pulls secrets from AWS Secrets Manager and turns them into Kubernetes Secrets using a tool called External Secrets Operator (ESO).

Breakdown:

    Terraform Configuration:
        mysql_secrets.tf and redis_secrets.tf are used to create the secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. These files define the credentials for MySQL and Redis, which will be securely stored in AWS.
        secret_manager.tf (in terraform/roles/) creates an IAM Role in AWS that allows Kubernetes to access those secrets. The IAM Role grants permissions to read secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.
        variables.tf and outputs.tf are helper files that provide reusable variables and outputs, including the IAM Role ARN, for further use in Kubernetes configurations.
    Kubernetes Configuration:
        service-account.yaml: This file creates a Kubernetes ServiceAccount and links it to the IAM role, which allows pods to use AWS credentials securely through IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts).
        secret-store.yaml: It tells ESO to use AWS Secrets Manager as the source for secrets and authenticate using the ServiceAccount created earlier.
        external-secrets-mysql.yaml & external-secrets-redis.yaml: These files instruct ESO to fetch the MySQL and Redis secrets from AWS Secrets Manager and store them as Kubernetes secrets (e.g., mysql-credentials and redis-credentials).

✅ Step 2: Fetch Secrets from AWS into Kubernetes 📥

Purpose: Pull credentials for MySQL and Redis from AWS Secrets Manager and store them as Kubernetes secrets.

    external-secrets-mysql.yaml

    Defines an ExternalSecret that pulls the MySQL password from AWS Secrets Manager and creates a Kubernetes Secret called mysql-credentials.

    external-secrets-redis.yaml

    Does the same, but for the Redis password, saved as redis-credentials.

These secrets are automatically kept in sync with AWS, so updates in Secrets Manager get reflected in the cluster.
✅ Step 3: Set Up Persistent Storage for MySQL 💾

Purpose: Ensure MySQL keeps data even if the pod restarts.

    mysql-pv.yaml

    Defines a PersistentVolume: a piece of disk on the host/node reserved for MySQL data.

    mysql-pvc.yaml

    Defines a PersistentVolumeClaim: a request from the MySQL pod asking to use storage.

This ensures MySQL doesn’t lose data across restarts.
✅ Step 4: Deploy the MySQL Database 🛢️

Purpose: Run MySQL in the cluster and connect it to the PVC and credentials.

    mysql-service.yaml

    Creates a ClusterIP service so that other pods (like the Node.js app) can talk to MySQL using mysql:3306.

    mysql-statefulset.yaml

    Deploys MySQL using a StatefulSet (ideal for databases), mounts the PVC, and loads credentials from the secret mysql-credentials.

This sets up a persistent, secure MySQL database that other services can access.
✅ Step 5: Deploy Redis ⚡

Purpose: Launch Redis so it’s accessible to the Node.js app.

    redis-deployment.yaml

    Deploys a Redis pod. It uses a password pulled via External Secrets Operator from AWS Secrets Manager and stored in the Kubernetes Secret redis-credentials. This secret is not referenced directly in the Redis deployment, assuming default unauthenticated setup, but is used securely in the Node.js app instead.

    redis-service.yaml

    Creates a ClusterIP service named redis so other pods can access it via redis:6379.

Redis will act as a cache layer for your Node.js application.
✅ Step 6: Deploy the Node.js Application 🌐

Purpose: Launch the app and give it access to MySQL and Redis.

    Key Concepts:

        Node.js Container: The Node.js application is deployed in a container, with the Docker image being pulled from a registry (e.g., Amazon ECR or Docker Hub).

        Snippet: Pulling the Docker image from Amazon ECR:

        image: <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-node-app:latest

Environment Variables:

    DB_HOST: Points to the MySQL service inside the Kubernetes cluster (usually mysql).
    REDIS_HOST: Points to the Redis service inside the Kubernetes cluster (usually redis).
    These environment variables are essential for the app to connect to MySQL and Redis.

Snippet: Setting environment variables for MySQL and Redis connection:

env:
  - name: DB_HOST
    value: "mysql"  # MySQL service within Kubernetes cluster
  - name: DB_PORT
    value: "3306"
  - name: REDIS_HOST
    value: "redis"  # Redis service within Kubernetes cluster
  - name: REDIS_PORT
    value: "6379"

Secrets Management:

    Credentials (like MySQL and Redis passwords) are securely injected into the Node.js application using Kubernetes secrets, which are managed by the External Secrets Operator. These secrets are synchronized with AWS Secrets Manager.

    Snippet: Fetching secrets from Kubernetes for MySQL and Redis credentials:

    env:
      - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: mysql-credentials  # The secret created from ExternalSecretsOperator
            key: password
      - name: REDIS_PASSWORD
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: redis-credentials  # The secret created from ExternalSecretsOperator
            key: password

    The application fetches the credentials via environment variables, ensuring secure access to MySQL and Redis.

Service Exposure:

    The app is exposed to the internet via a LoadBalancer service on port 80, which forwards traffic to the internal app port 3000.

    Snippet: Exposing the Node.js app through a LoadBalancer:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: node-app-service
    spec:
      selector:
        app: node-app
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80  # Public-facing port
          targetPort: 3000  # Internal app port
      type: LoadBalancer

        This makes the Node.js API publicly accessible for external communication.

🔗 Public-Facing API: The Node.js service is now accessible from outside the cluster, handling requests from users or other services.
✅ Step 7: Use Kustomize to Manage All Resources 🧩

Purpose: Deploy all files in one clean, modular way.
🛠️ What is Kustomize?

Kustomize is a tool built into kubectl that lets you group, customize, and deploy Kubernetes resources without editing the original files.

Instead of doing:

kubectl apply -f file1.yaml
kubectl apply -f file2.yaml
kubectl apply -f file3.yaml

You just write one file — kustomization.yaml — and run:

kubectl apply -k .

📄 Example kustomization.yaml file

apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
  - service-account.yaml
  - secret-store.yaml
  - external-secrets-mysql.yaml
  - external-secrets-redis.yaml
  - mysql-pv.yaml
  - mysql-pvc.yaml
  - mysql-statefulset.yaml
  - mysql-service.yaml
  - redis-deployment.yaml
  - redis-service.yaml
  - dep-node.yaml
  - service-node.yaml

💡 Why use Kustomize?

    Keeps your deployment modular and organized.
    Lets you reuse and overlay configs across environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
    Supports config changes without editing original manifests.

🔗 It’s the tool that brings structure and manageability to your Kubernetes setup.
